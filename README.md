# Scouting-app-server
This is the reciever for the data sent by the [1595 Scouting App](https://github.com/1595Dragons/Scouting-app), or rather a "server" of sorts. Made in java, and runs using the [BlueCove java lib](http://bluecove.org).


## Prerequisites
In order for the program to work you will need:
* A laptop with Bluetooth
* Windows (*macOS doesnt support 32 bit apps*)
* The [program itself](https://github.com/1595Dragons/Scouting-app-server/raw/master/1595ScoutingApp.exe)


## Installing
Everything that you *should* need is in the [included program](https://github.com/1595Dragons/Scouting-app-server/raw/master/1595ScoutingApp.exe), as it has the necesasry runtime, libraries, and classes wrapped in it. Just download it, and then run it. 

If the scouting_data csv is missing, then it will make a new one, and print the locaion to the console

## Before using
Be sure to pair all the phones taht you plan to use for scouting to the laptop/server, and be sure to get the laptops/servers MAC Address. The address is printed when you first start the program.
