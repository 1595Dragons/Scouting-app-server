This is the reciever for the data sent by the [1595 Scouting App](https://github.com/1595Dragons/Scouting-app), or rather a "server" of sorts. Made in java, and runs using the [BlueCove java lib](http://bluecove.org).


## Prerequisites
In order for the program to work you will need:
* A laptop with Bluetooth
* Windows (*macOS doesnt support 32 bit apps*)
* A [32-bit JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
* The jar itself


## Installing
All you need is the incuded jar (*Link to come, sorry*), along with a **[32 bit JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)**. The 32-bit JRE is called "Windows x86", and you can decide whether you want the online install or the offline install. 

Download the jar to somewhere easy to find, like you desktop, and then open open up a command promt window by pressing `windows + R` and then typing `cmd`

Once at the command promt, navgate to the location of the jar. If you put it on your desktop, just type `cd Desktop`

When you get to the locaiton of the jar, run it by typing `java -d32 -jar ` and then the name of the jar. Just start typing the name, and then press `tab` to auto-compete the name
